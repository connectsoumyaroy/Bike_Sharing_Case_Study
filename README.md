# BoomBikes Demand Forecasting

## Project Overview

BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing provider, has faced significant revenue drops due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Struggling to stay afloat in the current market, the company aims to devise a strategic business plan to boost revenue once the lockdown is lifted and the economy stabilizes.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:
- To understand the demand for shared bikes post-quarantine by developing a linear model.
- To identify key variables affecting revenue and predict bike demand.
- To evaluate the modelâ€™s accuracy in describing bike demand.

By achieving these objectives, BoomBikes aims to better meet customer needs, outperform competitors, and achieve substantial profits.

## Business Goal

The goal is to model the demand for shared bikes using the available independent variables. This model will help the management understand how demand varies with different features. The insights gained will enable them to adjust their business strategy to meet demand levels and satisfy customer expectations, providing a clear understanding of the demand dynamics in a new market.

## Insights

### Seasonal Demand
- **Fall (Category 3):** Highest median demand.
- **Spring (Category 1):** Lowest median demand.

### Yearly Comparison
- **2019:** Higher user count compared to 2018.

### Weekly Trends
- **Weekdays:** Demand remains almost constant, indicating the weekday variable may not be crucial for prediction.

### Weather Impact
- **Clear Weather:** User count ranges from 4000 to 6000.

### Monthly Trends
- **Mid-Month:** Bookings often exceed 4000.
- **October:** Highest demand count.

### Holiday Effect
- **Holidays:** Lower user count.

### Working Days
- **Bookings:** Range from 4000 to 6000 regardless of whether it is a working day.

## Recommendations

- **Focus Months:** January, July, September, November, and December show higher demand and should be prioritized.
- **Weather Tracking:** Demand increases with temperature, so weather conditions should be monitored.
- **Winter Season:** Prepare for high demand during the Winter season to meet customer needs effectively.

## Conclusion

By following the insights and recommendations outlined above, BoomBikes can strategically plan to meet the anticipated post-quarantine demand for shared bikes, ensuring customer satisfaction and increasing profitability.
